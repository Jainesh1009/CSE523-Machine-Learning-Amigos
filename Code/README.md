### Temperature_final.ipynb
In Temperature_final.ipynb, first of all we import our dataset and did the data preprocessing. Next, we move on to featuere selection process.

 
There are 4 different feature selection process used : 
1) Extra Tree Classifier
2) Information Gain
3) Backward Feature Elimination
4) Correlation



Any one of the process can be used at a time to obtain the best features.


Next, we did different regression techniques also :
1) Multiple Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Ridge Regression 
4) Lasso Regression

We also made our own custom functions of Multiple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression by minimising the cost function using gradient descent algorithm.
We can run all theses different techniques and then compare the accuracy between them.

We got best feature selection from backward feature elimination and got good accuracy from polynomial regression.

### Rainfall.ipynb


Next, in Rainfall.ipynb, first of all we import our dataset and did the data preprocessing.


Next, we move on to featuere selection process.
There are 2 different feature selection process used :
1) Backward Feature Elimination
2) Correlation
Any one of them can be used at a time to obtain the best features.


Next, we did different regression techniques also :
1) Multiple Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression


We can run both these techniques and then compare the accuracy between them.

### Multivariate_Regression.ipynb


Next, in Multivariate_Regression.ipynb, first of all we import our dataset and did the data preprocessing. 

Here we have predicted temperature along with humidity.


Here, we directly used the 2 regression techniques:
1) Multiple Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression

We can run both these techniques and then compare the accuracy between them
